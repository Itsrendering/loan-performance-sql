## Key Findings

- A majority of loan defaults came from borrowers with credit scores below 650.

- Higher credit score borrowers (750+) had the lowest default rate.

# Loan Performance Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan performance data to evaluate bank risk exposure and profitability using SQL. The goal is to identify default trends, assess borrower risk using credit scores, and estimate interest-based revenue across different loan terms.

This project simulates real-world financial data analysis performed by bank data analysts and credit risk teams.

## Dataset
The dataset contains loan-level records with the following fields:

- loan_id
- loan_amount
- interest_rate
- loan_term
- credit_score
- income
- state
- loan_status
- issue_date

## Key Business Questions Answered
- How much total capital has been loaned by the bank?
- What is the overall loan default rate?
- Which credit score ranges carry the highest risk?
- Which loan terms generate the most estimated interest revenue?

## Key Findings
- Loan defaults are most concentrated among borrowers with credit scores below 650.
- 60-month loans generate higher estimated interest revenue but also carry higher default risk.
- Borrowers with credit scores above 750 show the lowest default rates.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Flat file data (CSV)
- GitHub for version control

## How This Project Is Used
This analysis can help financial institutions:
- Improve credit approval strategies
- Adjust interest rates by risk tier
- Balance profitability with default risk
